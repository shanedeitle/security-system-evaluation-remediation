# Security System Evaluation & Remediation – Fielder Medical Center

## Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive security evaluation and remediation plan** for **Fielder Medical Center**.  
The plan identifies gaps in the organization's security framework, evaluates risk levels, and provides actionable remediation strategies to align with **NIST SP 800-53** controls and **PCI DSS** requirements.

## Key Deliverables
- **Gap Analysis:** Evaluated deficiencies in security controls, policies, and outdated system design.
- **Risk Ratings:** Classified controls (AC-6, CA-5, CA-7, RA-3, RA-7) as Moderate or High, with justifications.
- **Remediation Strategies:** Action plans for addressing gaps, including MFA implementation, access control policy updates, and vulnerability management processes.
- **PCI DSS–Compliant Policies:** Developed policies for firewall configuration, password management, and antivirus protection with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
