# Network Merger & Implementation Plan

## Overview
This project provides a **secure network merger and implementation plan** for two organizations with distinct security and infrastructure challenges.  
It delivers a **hybrid-cloud network design** that addresses existing vulnerabilities, aligns with **HIPAA** and **PCI DSS** compliance requirements, and meets budgetary constraints.

---

## Key Deliverables
- **Vulnerability & Risk Assessment:** Identified critical issues, including weak passwords, open ports, lack of MFA, and remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- **Merged Network Topology:** Designed a secure network architecture with VLAN segmentation, DMZ for external services, Fortinet firewall protection, and hybrid cloud integration.
- **OSI & TCP/IP Mapping:** Detailed mapping of network components across the OSI and TCP/IP models for enhanced visibility and troubleshooting.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Addressed HIPAA for healthcare data protection and PCI DSS for financial transaction security.
- **Emerging Threats:** Identified zero-day exploits and AI-powered attacks as key risks and proposed mitigation strategies.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Developed a hybrid infrastructure strategy balancing on-premises control and cloud scalability within a $50,000 first-year budget.
